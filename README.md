# CAPTCHAs_solver_CRNN
A deep learning model to break CAPTCHA codes perfectly using CRNN model (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network).

## Description

CAPTCHAs stands for the Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart. CAPTCHAs are tools you can use to differentiate between real users and automated users, such as bots. CAPTCHAs provide challenges that are difficult for computers to perform but relatively easy for humans.

This project will use a CRNN model which is a combination of CNN, RNN and CTC loss for image-based sequence recognition tasks, specially OCR (Optical Character Recognition) task.
